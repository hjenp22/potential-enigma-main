# Week-9 Professinal README Generator
</div>

## Description 
The objective of this week's assignment was to develop a command-line tool for generating README files. The goal was to streamline the process of crafting professional READMEs for new projects, enabling me to dedicate more time to the actual project itself rather than on README creation. Throughout this task, I successfully crafted a functional Express.js API and seamlessly integrated Sequelize for smooth interaction with the MySQL database.
